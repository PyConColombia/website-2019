We are really happy to announce the PyCon Colombia 2019 Scholarships! We believe that a diverse set of viewpoints and opinions is really important to build a thriving community. In an ideal world, every part of the tech community would be made up of people from all walks of life. However the reality is that we must be proactive and make an effort to make sure everybody has a voice. We know PyCon Colombia can be expensive, specially if you need to arrange travel and accommodation, that is why this scholarship is also aimed at supporting people that do currently have the means to attend to the conference.

We consider that this scholarship could be of great benefit for:

* Members of underrepresented and vulnerable communities in the Technology Field.
* Those studying or working in computer science or a related field without means to attend the conference.

To apply for the scholarship, please read the following guidelines and fill in the form provided by the link at the bottom.

Bear in mind that each application will be reviewed individually by the **[PyCon Colombia Organizing Team](https://pycon.co/en/team)** and ranked according to the answers provided in the application form and in the letter of intent.

_Sending your application does not guarantee that you are immediately elegible. See the Terms & Conditions_
