description:

I will share with you the process we followed at my current company to build an ETL pipeline to a client. The idea is to be as real as I can be, explaining the perks and drawbacks of using Python to build it. The solution we built involves the usage of Pandas, Django and many other awesome libraries.

Although the main theme of the talk is how we built the ETL pipeline, I want to to give it it in a different, curious way: by telling you a story. 

My talk will be divided in 5 parts:

**Introduction ~ 1 min:** Learn a little bit about who am I and what I've done.
**Setting : ~ 4 min:** Just like an storyteller, who describes the environment or surroundings of the story, I will tell you succinctly why my company needed to build an ETL process, how we approach the problem and how finally we decided to use Python to build it. 
**Plot ~ 24 min (each part taking up to 6 min):** Where I tell the story of how I built an ETL using python. It has 4 chapters:
1. *How it all began*: Defining the right questions: I share how important it is to define which questions you want to answer as your first step in the ETL process.
2. *Python increased the size! Insufficient RAM and other drawbacks*: Dataframes are awesome, but not so awesome when you eat up to 12 GB of RAM performing a simple join.
3. *God bless Python dictionaries*: Of how you can receive/build or send any object using python dicts and how compatible are they with other formats such as JSON.
4. *Measure, measure, measure!* : I share how you might estimate how long the ETL will take given the size of the data and the implementation.


**Resolution and moral ~ 6 min:** Final thoughts of the implementation of the ETL 
**Questions ~ 5 min**

summary: This is the story of an engineer who enters a jungle of data and builds an ETL in order to make sense out of it. You'll learn about data modelling, how a JOIN operation may eat up your RAM and many other perks and drawbacks of using Python to build the pipeline. Sit and join him in his adventure.
